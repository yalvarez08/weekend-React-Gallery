# Project Name
*** Weekend Challenge: React Gallery ***

## Description

This project involved creating a gallery page to share photos of things that are important to me. The page displays a header, a form, and a gallery list. 

Users can interact with the page using the `Toggle Image` button and `Like üëç` button. 
- By clicking the `Toggle Image` button, the image toggles between the image itself and a description of the image.
- By clicking the `Like üëç` button, the user can like the image and the 'number of likes' increases.

In the form section, users can also input in the fields `url`, `title`, and `description`. Once they click the `Add To Gallery` button, the gallery item uploads to page and users are able to see their entry in the gallery of photos below.
